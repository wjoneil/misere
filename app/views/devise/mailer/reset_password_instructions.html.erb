<p>Hello <%= @resource.email %>!</p>

<p>Someone has requested a link to change your Misere password. You can do this through the link below.</p>

<p><%= link_to 'Change my password', edit_password_url(@resource, :reset_password_token => @resource.reset_password_token) %></p>

<p>If you didn't request this, then someone must be really desperate to play 500 as you.</p>
<p>Anyway, your password won't change until you access the link above and create a new one.</p>

<p>kind regards,</p>

<p>The mailer robot</p>
