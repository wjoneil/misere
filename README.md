Misère
======

Misère is an application that scores and tracks games of [500][1].

* Never forget how many points a bid of seven hearts is worth!
* No longer rely on anecdotal evidence about how much better you are at 500 than your siblings and cousins!
* Don't worry about forgetting the score because it's 1am and you're exhausted after been playing non-stop for five hours!

About
-----

500 is the inevitable card game dragged out for serious, no-holds-barred tournament play at practically every family gathering I attend. I was sick of keeping track of scores manually, and felt like there was a wealth of data about bids and scores waiting to be collated.

Current Limitations
-------------------

Because it's currently only designed to be run locally, there's no way to host it anywhere because all the data is global, which isn't really practical. Once I add user accounts I'll put it up somewhere.
